# Encrypted Chat Application

### [Live Site](https://react-web-encryption.netlify.app/join?room=gORcAPZ6nLnI1OmPgspuL_2DDvfJV2SJVC5NWuJhs5w)

To start chatting, start a session and share the link with a friend! Your messages will never be stored and are encrypted so nobody (including us) can see the contents of your messages!

Setup:
- run ```npm i && npm start``` for both client and server side to start the development server
